# Inetech Office Mover 5000

Inetech Office Mover 5000 is a cross-platform example of a collaborative app written on
[Firebase](https://firebase.com). It helps you and your coworkers plan the layout of your
office furniture with a realtime drag-and-drop interface.

It illustrates using Firebase on web, iOS, and Android. It also illustrates Firebase login
with Google.

Check out the [web demo](https://office-mover-demo.firebaseapp.com/).
